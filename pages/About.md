<br />Traincraft first came out in April of 2011.
<br />At that time the mod was named "Train and Zeppelin mod" and only had one steam locomotive and one cart.
<br />The locomotive had no GUI and you couldn't attach the cart to the locomotive.
<br />The first idea was to have a controllable powered minecart in which you could sit.
<br />The mod got so much support that it was decided to continue the adventure, and over 80 more locomotives and carts were added.
<br />As time went on Spitfire4466 and Mr. Brutal could no longer maintain the mod and updates stalled into 1.6.4.
<br />About three years later they agreed to open it up for the community to maintain.
<br />
<br />Now Traincraft has a regularly expanding number of trains and rollingstock, all made by both the new team and the community.
<br />Three years more into development from a new team Spitfire came back to help add direction to development.
<br />
<br />The maintainers aren't the only thing that changed.
<br />The notes left by Mr. Brutal and Spitfire said a rewrite would be needed to address a lot of issues, and that's just what we did.
<br />A new mod called Trains in Motion (TiM) was developed to simplify all the needed underworkings.
<br />Traincraft releases have this mod inbuilt, so you don't have to download two different mods!
<br />Developing the core seperatley has allowed for far easier maintainability across many minecraft versions.
<br />We hope it will also help across different modloaders, alongside everything from 1.7 to 1.17, and hopefully beyond.
<br />One unfortunate exception is Bedrock, which we will be unable to support for the forseeable future due it it's vast limits.
<br />
<br />Traincraft always had a history of working with the community
<br />But since opening full source to the community there has been a massive number of contributions, mostly for models.
<br />To ensure everything looks and feels right we have a number of rules that content needs to abode by to get in.
<br />With Traincraft-4.5 we intend to help groups that want to make content with their own unique styles, not just our own.
<br />We intend to do this will full support for flans-esk add-ons.
<br />We chose a flans-like style over more modern content packs because the flans style is actually a mod itself.
<br />On the front that makes it seem more difficult, and admittedly it is to some small extent.
<br />But it removes all limits for content creators, allowing not just custom trains and stock, but everything from custom blocks to tracks and entity logic.
<br />Over time we intend to write new ways for features to be interacted with, both to add new functionality, and further simplify them for users with no experience.
<br />
<br />We will be adding many new features to set the groundwork for many years to come.
<br />New rails with support for vanilla and Track API, while still keeping TC's iconic puzzle-piece design, with all the old shapes, and some new ones.
<br />Trains are finally getting the attention they deserve, we'll be adding in animations, dynamic lighting and model fixes.
<br />We're taking the extra time to be sure, even with all the new features, the mod will run better on weaker computers and weaker internet connections.
<br />However one thing we don't wanna change is the core gameplay. TC was always a very unique mod, even with 4+ other active train mods, it's still unique,
<br />We believe that's one of the many things that makes it strong.
<br />No matter how much gets changed or added we want to be sure you can pick it up, and it still feels like Traincraft.
