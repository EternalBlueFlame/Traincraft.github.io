One Of the lead Engineers for Traincraft, the lead designer and engineer for Trains in Motion (TiM).<br/>
I've been developing software since I was 13, a lot of those projects are water under the bridge now, One of the few things that has stuck around is Traincraft.<br/>
I also currently have some other side projects going like a cryptocurrency miner, and I work as tech support for the Cudo cryptocurrency pool.<br/>
